      "> In computer science, partial application (or partial function application) refers to the process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller arity. Given a function $\\scriptstyle f \\colon (X \\times Y \\times Z) \\to N$ , we might fix (or 'bind') the first argument, producing a function of type  $\\scriptstyle\\text{partial}(f) \\colon (Y \\times Z) \\to N$ .  Evaluation of this function might be represented as $f_{partial}(2, 3)$. Note that the result of partial function application in this case is a function that takes two arguments.\n",

That is, while an evaluation of the first function might be represented as $\\scriptstyle f(1, 2, 3)$, evaluation of the curried function would be represented as $\\scriptstyle f_\\text{curried}(1)(2)(3)$, applying each argument in turn to a single-argument function returned by the previous invocation.

However you might find it getting used in context of python, and more often than not, it might mean partial application.

[functools.lru_cache](http://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functools.html) is a memoization decorator. "

In the above example \"/show\" is the url_prefix that if matched should result in the show handler function being called. The routes engine is matches an incoming request to the routes in the list, and if a match is found, then the corresponding handler function is called giving it the request as an argument. Without decorators, you would need a separate place where all the routes and their handlers could be configured (sometimes called wiring up). With decorators like above, this configuration can be done at the site of each function declaration. (The part where the runtime discovers all such functions and calls them once in order to actually perform the registration is beyond the scope of this post). We could use decorators similarly to register event listeners etc."

Much of what class decorators achieve can also be achieved through metaprogramming, and more often than not, being able to write good class decorator requires a decent understanding of the class meta model.\n",
